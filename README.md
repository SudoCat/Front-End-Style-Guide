# Front-End-Style-Guide
A style guide for crafting standardised, flexible, maintainable HTML &amp; CSS. Thanks to all the incredible developers who have pathed the way for me.

## Why?
First things first, let's get this out of the way:
*CSS sucks*

"CSS and HTML are easy, why would I need to use a style guide?" I hear you ask? Well, while it may be a cake-walk to spew out HTML &amp; CSS, writing high quality, durable and maintainable HTML &amp; CSS takes a bit more planning and forethought. While they are not a bullet proof solution, Style Guides can often help you with making smart decisions for your project.

When it comes to working in teams, style guides can prove to be an invaluable tool. They encourage your team to work in harmony, producing consistent code, enabling anyone to jump into any project and understand what they're dealing with. This can be especially crucial when working in long term projects, where code bases easily grow into chaos seemingly overnight. 

To summarise, the goals of a style guide are
- Keep stylesheets maintainable;
- Keep code transparent, sane and readable;
- Keep stylesheets scalable

I don't want to rehash too much here, so I advise reading into some of the great posts out in the wild from people like Harry Roberts. Hopefully I'll manage to add a list of helpful articles later.
